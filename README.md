# offChainer
Tools to have ethereum develop smart contract interacting with off-chain data and computation.
Aims at facilitating development of smart contract in scenarios where some data and associated computation
needs to be off-chain, either for privacy or efficiency reasons.
We take computations out of the smart contract, while ensuring correctness, using commitments and zk-proofs.
